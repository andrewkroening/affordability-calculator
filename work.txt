change the tabs

parameters up top
add years

tab1: general output
tab2: price-rate payment matrix
tab3: price-rate total cost
tab4: bar graphs to show cost comparison with tool tip for payment

get rid of the bottom table

logic
table gen needs to be fixed massively for this
need to have the current functions go somewhere to be compiled
have to make it generate the matrix for the heatmaps
